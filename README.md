## üîß Configuration

The agent can be configured via `config.py`:

```python
# Search Parameters
MAX_PAPERS_PER_QUERY = 50
MIN_CITATION_COUNT = 5
RECENT_YEARS_THRESHOLD = 3

# Output Settings
DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FORMAT = "markdown"
MAX_ABSTRACT_LENGTH = 500
```

## üåê API Integration

### Semantic Scholar API
- **Primary source** for academic papers
- **No API key required**
- Provides citation counts, abstracts, author info

### arXiv API
- **Preprint source** for latest research
- **No API key required**
- Covers computer science, physics, math, biology

### OpenAI API (Optional)
- **Enhanced summarization** capabilities
- Requires API key
- Improves research synthesis quality

## üìù Example Queries

### Computer Science
- "transformer neural networks"
- "federated learning privacy"
- "graph neural networks"
- "reinforcement learning robotics"

### Medicine & Biology
- "CRISPR gene editing"
- "COVID-19 vaccine development"
- "cancer immunotherapy"
- "Alzheimer's disease biomarkers"

### Physics & Engineering
- "quantum computing algorithms"
- "renewable energy storage"
- "autonomous vehicle safety"
- "climate change modeling"

### Social Sciences
- "social media mental health"
- "remote work productivity"
- "artificial intelligence ethics"
- "educational technology effectiveness"

## üîç Interactive Features

The CLI supports interactive mode where you can ask follow-up questions:

```bash
python cli.py research "deep learning" --interactive

# Then ask questions like:
‚ùì Your question: Tell me more about the key authors
‚ùì Your question: What are the main publication venues?
‚ùì Your question: What research gaps did you identify?
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No papers found**
   - Try broader search terms
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible

2. **Rate limiting errors**
   - The agent includes built-in delays
   - If issues persist, increase `API_DELAY_SECONDS` in config

3. **Missing dependencies**
   - Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed
   - Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

### Check System Status
```bash
python cli.py status --check-apis
```

## ü§ù Contributing
